# Description:
This is a multi-page Space Tourism project from Scrimba and Frontend mentor. I was heavily encouraged to come up with my own solutions and most of the code is my own. I made a lot of decisions that were different than the instructor Kevin and I kept them. This lead me to regret some of those decisions later on...

For example, instead of using Kevin's grid template that worked for most layouts, I ended up making my own grid template for every breakpoint. I found that this was a much more tedious and less maintainable solution as I went further along. I found out through a ton of trail and error just how important it is to be able keep the code modular for use later on. It was a tough yet fun learning experience

## What I learned
- Grid layouts should be thought out with respect to every screen size on the design file, do not work on them separately
- Lots of modern accessibility features, including sr-only utility class, skip-to-content, and tab indices 
- How a tab system might be implemented in JS
- How to keep things tidy with good class naming conventions

## What I want to try in the future:
- Use the JSON file to grab the content instead of having it all in the HTML file
- Try more simplistic grid system that will fit more layouts
- Refactor the JS tab navigation to make it a bit less redundant. Explore other solutions and compare pros and cons
